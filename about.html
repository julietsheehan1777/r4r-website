                <p class="content-text">
                    At the end of 2019, Fairfax stopped picking up glass to recycle and instead asked people to bring it to the recycling plants themselves. Worried that the inconvenience would impact local waste and environmental conditions, two brothers in the McLean MCNA neighborhood began a small-scale effort to collect glass from their neighbors.

                <p class="content-text">
                    Five years later, the brothers graduated, and there was no one to lead the recycling.

                <p class="content-text">
                    As one of the families whose glass was collected, Juliet Sheehan wanted to make sure that the effort continued. At the same time, bills were being passed that restricted funding to medical research and programs. As someone who was medically inclined and had countless thanks to give to hospitals for their treatments, she wanted to find a way to support health research to improve both the American and global healthcare systems.

                <p class="content-text">
                    Juliet took over the glass recycling program, asking that in exchange for a free glass pickup, the participants would donate to <a href="charity.html" class="text-link">Research!America</a>, a charity that supports American health research and global health improvement.

                    The small recycling effort turned into Recycle4Research, which is currently expanding and becoming an official organization. We continue to serve the McLean community, collecting glass every other week and supporting vital medical research through every pickup.
